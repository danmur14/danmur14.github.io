**Software Engineer**

- Developed database services and ETL pipelines that provide metadata and workflows for standard or custom data sets loaded from disparate sources, transformed using SQL, then output to cloud databases or as feeds.
- Programmed Ruby on Rails based microservices that implemented MySQL databases for all data sets, triggers, history, feeds, and workflow processing metadata.
- Enhanced an ETL Java pipeline that performs big data transformations, serialization, and reporting on custom data sets and loads them to cloud databases.
- Implemented a Ruby microservice that communicates with datasinks in HDFS clusters and AWS S3 buckets to preview client uploaded files for data set transformations.
- Deprecated a Ruby service that read datasink changelog entries and replaced functionality with a recurring Java workflow, updating database metadata in batches for HDFS. For files uploaded to S3 buckets, replaced with an AWS Lambda for higher efficiency.
- Reduced data set processing time by 30% by implementing a Ruby delayed job wrapper and kick off. 
- Increased the success rate of data set error table population from 40% to 100% success rate by reconfiguring dependency injection with the Guice API while initializing the processing pipeline.
- Managed configuration and automated deployment of jobs and services across environments using DC/OS, Spinnaker, Chef, Spork, and Docker.
